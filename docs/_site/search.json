I have been a permanent resident of Canada since 2029.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly non-fiction graphic novels), biking, and playing chess (I have a 1600 chess.com rating). I write as a hobby and have won third place in a national contest of really short stories (my micro tales have been included in a couple of anthologies). I was first published in English in “Writing in the Time of COVID.”"
